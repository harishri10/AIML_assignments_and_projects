There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "1) Does averaging the validation accuracy across multiple splits give more consistent results?\n",
        "Yes, averaging across multiple random splits helps reduce the variance caused by a single train-validation split. It makes the validation accuracy more stable and less dependent on the specific data distribution in one run. This consistency is especially useful when the dataset is small or unbalanced.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Does it give more accurate estimate of test accuracy?\n",
        "Yes, averaging over multiple validation splits generally leads to a better approximation of test accuracy. Since each split represents a slightly different sampling of the data, the average across them captures a more generalized performance, reducing overfitting to any one validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What is the effect of the number of iterations on the estimate? Do we get a better estimate with higher iterations?\n",
        "Increasing the number of iterations improves the reliability of the estimate by smoothing out anomalies in any single split. Initially, more iterations significantly improve stability, but after a certain point, the gain becomes marginal. Typically, 5–10 iterations are enough, but for high-stakes tasks or noisy data, even more can help.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Can we deal with a very small train dataset or validation dataset by increasing the iterations?\n",
        "To some extent, yes. When either the train or validation set is small, increasing the number of splits helps cover different parts of the data and compensates for limited information in each split. However, it does not replace the benefit of having a larger dataset. Iterations can reduce variance, but they cannot fix underfitting due to very little training data."
